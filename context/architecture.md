# Architecture

## Stack

| Layer | Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Framework | Next.js 16 (App Router) | Full stack framework |
| UI Library | React 19.2.4 | Component rendering |
| Database | PostgreSQL + Prisma | Relational storage for auth, profiles, interviews, questions, analytics |
| Authentication | Better Auth | Email/password + Google OAuth, JWT + session cookies, single-active-session enforcement |
| Storage | InsForge Storage | File storage (uploaded resumes). Cloudinary is an acceptable drop-in alternative if InsForge limits become a problem — keep storage access behind `lib/storage.ts` so the provider can be swapped without touching callers. |
| AI model | Kimi 2.6 (OpenAI-compatible SDK, custom baseURL) | Interview question generation, real-time answer evaluation, feedback synthesis, resume extraction |
| Speech-to-text | Browser Web Speech API | In-browser voice-to-text for answer input. No server-side audio processing. |
| Proctoring | Fullscreen API + Page Visibility API + Screen Capture detection (client-side only) | Detect fullscreen exit, tab switch, minimize, screenshot attempts. No video/screen recording is stored — violations are detected and acted on client-side only. |
| PDF/DOCX parsing | pdf-parse (PDF) + mammoth (DOCX) | Extract text from uploaded resumes before sending to Kimi for profile auto-fill |
| Analytics | PostHog | Event tracking and dashboard charts |
| Forms | TanStack Form + Zod | Schema-driven auth, settings, and wizard validation |
| Data tables | TanStack Table v8 | Client-side history table filtering, search, pagination, and row model management |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS v4 + shadcn/ui | UI components and styling |
| Language | TypeScript strict | Throughout |

## System Boundaries

| Folder | Owns |
| --- | --- |
| `app/` | Pages and API routes only. No business logic. |
| `agent/` | All Kimi prompt construction and response parsing — question generation, answer evaluation, feedback aggregation, resume extraction. Nothing here touches React. |
| `actions/` | Server Actions for UI-triggered mutations — auth, profile, settings, and writing interview/question rows. |
| `components/` | UI only. No data fetching logic, no direct DB or Kimi calls. |
| `lib/` | Third-party client initialization, proctoring listeners, and shared utilities only. |
| `types/` | TypeScript types shared across the project. |

---

## Data Flow

### UI Mutations (Server Actions)

```
User interaction in component
        ↓
Server Action in actions/
        ↓
PostgreSQL DB write
        ↓
Revalidate or redirect
```

### Schema-Driven Forms (Client + Server Boundary)

```
User edits auth/settings/interview inputs in client form
        ↳
TanStack Form manages field state, touched state, and submit state
        ↳
Zod validates structure and user-facing constraints
        ↳
Client shows inline field errors plus a top-level alert summary
        ↳
Server action or route handler receives normalized payload
```

### Interview History Table (Client-side UI State)

```
app/history/page.tsx (Server Component)
        ↓
passes serializable interview rows only
        ↓
components/history/HistoryTable.tsx (Client Component)
        ↳
TanStack Table manages global search, role/type/time column filters,
pagination state, and filtered row models
        ↳
shadcn table primitives render the table
        ↳
shadcn dropdown-menu renders row overflow actions
        ↳
local delete action removes rows from client state for now
```

**Boundary rule:** server page data must stay plain and serializable. For example, history rows pass an icon key string such as `"code"` or `"brain"`; `HistoryTable.tsx` maps that key to the actual Lucide icon inside the client component. Do not pass React components, class instances, or objects with methods from `app/history/page.tsx` into `HistoryTable`.

Future database-backed history should replace the sample row array in `app/history/page.tsx` with server-fetched rows, while keeping filtering/pagination client-side unless the result set becomes large enough to require URL/search-param-backed server queries.

### Interview Setup Preview State (Client-side UI State)

```
app/interview/new/page.tsx (Server Component)
        ↓
renders dashboard shell only
        ↓
components/interview-setup/InterviewSetupPage.tsx (Client Component)
        ↳
local React state stores selected role, experience, type, skills,
context attachments, included sections, focus, duration, and timing
        ↳
shadcn dropdown-menu primitives manage option selection UI
        ↳
derived summary values render immediately in the right-side preview card
        ↳
future submit action can serialize this state into actions/interview.ts
```

**Boundary rule:** keep the interview setup page UI-first and client-local until the interview creation action is wired. Do not move prompt-building, persistence, or upload processing into the component; those belong in `actions/`, `agent/`, or `lib/`.

**Device gate rule:** keep the `Start Interview` device check in the client component so mobile and tablet browsers are blocked before any live-session routing or server mutation begins. Desktop browsers may proceed normally after the summary check passes.

### Question Generation (API Route, streaming)

```
User completes Start New Interview wizard, clicks "Start Interview" on a desktop browser
        ↓
actions/interview.ts creates `interviews` row (status: in_progress)
        ↓
API route app/api/interview/generate (streamed)
        ↓
agent/interviewer.ts builds prompt from profile + resume/JD context + wizard config
        ↓
Kimi 2.6 streams questions dynamically based on context (temperature 0.7)
        ↓
Questions written to `interview_questions` rows as they are generated
        ↓
Client renders questions progressively in QuestionsPanel
```

Mobile and tablet browsers are blocked before this flow starts, so the server-side generation path only receives desktop-originated interview launches.

### Session Completion & Evaluation (API Route)

```
User finishes interview or timer expires
        ↓
API route app/api/interview/complete
        ↓
agent/evaluator.ts evaluates all answers together
        → generates per-question scores/feedback + overall score,
          per-dimension averages, strengths[], areas_to_improve[],
          speaking_pace_rating, confidence_trend_data
        ↓
Row written to `interview_questions` (ai_feedback, scores_json) and `interview_analytics`
        ↓
interviews.status = 'completed', completed_at set, score = overall_score
        ↓
Dashboard / History / Analytics pages revalidated
```

### Proctoring Violation (Client-side)

```
ProctoringGuard detects: fullscreen exit | tab switch | window minimize | screenshot attempt
        ↓
Client immediately stops local recording state (no video stored)
        ↓
Client calls app/api/interview/[id]/abandon
        ↓
interviews.status = 'abandoned', completed_at set
        ↓
Redirect to /dashboard with proctoring violation status message
```

### Resume Operations (API Routes)

```
User uploads resume (PDF/DOCX) and selects "Extract from Resume"
        ↓
API route app/api/resume/extract
        ↓
PDF → pdf-parse text / DOCX → mammoth text
        ↓
agent/resume-extractor.ts → Kimi 2.6 structures text into profile fields
        ↓
Extracted fields returned to client for user review/edit
        ↓
actions/profile.ts saves confirmed fields + uploads original file to InsForge Storage
```

## InsForge Storage

| Bucket | Path | Contents |
| --- | --- | --- |
| resumes | resumes/{user_id}/uploaded.pdf or .docx | User-uploaded resume (for extraction) |

Access: authenticated users only, own files only. If InsForge limits become a blocker, swap to Cloudinary behind `lib/storage.ts` — no other files should reference the storage provider directly.

---

## Authentication

- System: [Better Auth](https://www.better-auth.com/) with PostgreSQL + Prisma persistence
- Methods: Email/password and Google OAuth only
- Tokens: JWT access token + Better Auth session/refresh token, both stored in HttpOnly cookies
- Single-active-session policy: logging in on a new device invalidates any existing non-expired session for that user, so only the latest session remains active
- Protected routes: `/dashboard`, `/interview/*`, `/history`, `/analytics`, `/resources`, `/settings`
- Public routes: `/`, `/login`, `/register`
- `middleware.ts` resolves the session via `/api/auth/get-session` and redirects unauthenticated users to `/login`; authenticated users are kept out of `/login` and `/register`
- On login/sign-up → redirect to `/dashboard`
- Auth API handler: `/api/auth/[...all]` (sign-in, sign-up, sign-out, Google OAuth, session refresh)

---

## PostgreSQL / Prisma Client Pattern

Auth and application data are persisted through Prisma ORM with a PostgreSQL driver adapter.

```typescript
// lib/prisma.ts
import { PrismaPg } from "@prisma/adapter-pg";
import { PrismaClient } from "../generated/prisma/client";

const adapter = new PrismaPg({ connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL });

const globalForPrisma = globalThis as unknown as {
  prisma: PrismaClient | undefined;
};

export const prisma = globalForPrisma.prisma ?? new PrismaClient({ adapter });

if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== "production") {
  globalForPrisma.prisma = prisma;
}
```

Raw `pg` queries are reserved for non-ORM use cases; auth and profile operations go through `prisma`.

---

## Kimi 2.6 Client Pattern

```typescript
// lib/kimi.ts
import OpenAI from "openai";

export const kimi = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: process.env.KIMI_API_KEY!,
  baseURL: process.env.KIMI_BASE_URL!, // Kimi's OpenAI-compatible endpoint
});
```

**Question generation (creative)** — `agent/interviewer.ts`, temperature `0.7`, `stream: true`.

**Answer evaluation & feedback (deterministic)** — `agent/evaluator.ts` and `agent/feedback.ts`, temperature `0.2`, `stream: true`.

---

## Web Speech API Pattern (Voice Answer Input)

```typescript
// components/interview-session/AnswerInput.tsx (client component)
const recognition = new (window.SpeechRecognition || window.webkitSpeechRecognition)();
recognition.continuous = true;
recognition.interimResults = true;
recognition.lang = "en-US"; // English-only for MVP

recognition.onresult = (event) => {
  const transcript = Array.from(event.results)
    .map((r) => r[0].transcript)
    .join(" ");
  // Append/update answer textarea state with transcript
};

// Fallback: if SpeechRecognition is unsupported, hide "Speak Answer"
// button and show text input only — never block submission.
```

No audio is sent to the server. All speech-to-text happens in the browser.

---

## Analytics Detail Page Interface Specification (Mockup-aligned)

The detailed analysis route at `/analytics/details` acts as a report-style deep dive into one completed interview and keeps the dashboard shell visible for navigation continuity.

### Page Structure

- **Top header block**: `Back to Analytics` link, `Detailed Analysis` title, completed status pill, short summary sentence, and session metadata chips for role, date, and duration.
- **Primary actions**: `Download Report` and `Share` buttons aligned to the right of the page header.
- **Main left column**:
  - Overall score card with a large circular progress ring and summary copy.
  - Four compact mini score rings for Clarity, Relevance, Technical Depth, and Confidence.
  - Strengths and Focus Areas cards with tokenized list rows and semantic tags.
  - Question detail card with score badge, previous/next controls, answer review, AI analysis, improvement suggestion, and a suggested practice row.
  - Communication section with speaking pace waveform, confidence sparkline, filler word count, and pause metric cards.
  - Next steps section with three recommendation cards and a retake CTA band.
- **Right sidebar**:
  - Question count header with an `All Questions` filter control.
  - Scrollable question list with answered, current, skipped, and not reached states.
  - Footer CTA to review only weak questions.
- **Client-side dummy state**:
  - Until real analytics records are wired, the detail page uses typed mock question data to drive question selection, previous/next controls, answer visibility, report/share feedback, and question filtering.

### Visual Rules

- Use the same `bg-surface`, `border-border`, `rounded-2xl`, and `shadow-sm` surface language as the dashboard.
- Keep score and trend visuals token-based so they continue to use the semantic accent, success, warning, error, and info palette.
- The sidebar should remain readable at roughly 320px wide and can stick near the top on wider screens when space allows.

---

## Interview Page Interface Specification (Mockup-aligned)

Based on the design mockup, the live interview page operates on a distraction-free grid that hides the primary dashboard sidebar/header and segments the session into two main columns:

### 1. Left Column: Main Interview Session
- **Welcome encouragement banner**: A top card displaying `Welcome back, [Name]!` with a waving hand illustration.
- **Session Metadata row**: Displaying four bordered info blocks:
  - **Role** (e.g., "Frontend Developer" with briefcase icon)
  - **Difficulty** (e.g., "Medium" with bar chart icon)
  - **Interview Type** (e.g., "Technical" with code `</>` icon)
  - **Time Remaining** (countdown timer with clock icon)
- **AI Interviewer Card**:
  - Avatar representing the chatbot AI with a pulsing status badge (`Speaking...` when voice output or response playback is active).
  - Outlined red `End Interview` action button on the top right.
  - Chat bubble housing Kimi's current question text.
  - A purple audio waveform visualization immediately below the chatbot bubble.
- **Your Answer Input Card**:
  - Textarea field with label `Your Answer` and placeholder text `Type or speak your answer here...`.
  - Left-aligned `Speak Answer` microphone button (initiates Web Speech API local transcription).
  - Right-aligned `Submit Answer` primary filled button (includes right arrow, styled with Accent theme variables).
  - Bottom help text: `Tip: Take your time. Think clearly before answering.`
- **Live Utility Tabs (Bottom Row)**:
  - **Live Analysis** (chevron-right -> opens client-side sliding drawer with local speaking tips and metrics).
  - **Interview Notes** (chevron-right -> opens text pane to jot down session thoughts).
  - **Settings** (chevron-right -> opens audio input/volume configurator).

### 2. Right Column: Questions Panel (Sidebar, 320px wide)
- **Questions Header**: Displays title and a close `X` button.
- **Progress indicators**: Displays attempt status text (e.g., `Progress: 3 / 8`) and a horizontal progress bar matching the score ratio.
- **Questions list (scrollable stack)**: Displays cards for each generated question.
  - **Answered status** (green circle with checkmark, light green background chip `Answered`, green check icon).
  - **Current status** (purple circle with index, purple border around card, light purple background chip `Current`).
  - **Pending status** (gray circle with index, light gray background chip `Pending`).
- **Footer CTA**: `View Answered Questions` button (list icon).

## Proctoring & Security Protocols

To maintain interview integrity and prevent plagiarism, the platform enforces a multi-layered security protocol crossing client and server boundaries:

### 1. Hard Proctoring Violations (Immediate Termination)
These actions represent clear intent to navigate away or copy content, resulting in immediate session termination. The client terminates voice transcription, halts the session, triggers the abandon endpoint, and redirects the user back to the dashboard with an error parameter:

- **Fullscreen Exit**:
  The interview forces browser fullscreen on launch. Exiting is tracked via `fullscreenchange`:
  ```typescript
  document.addEventListener("fullscreenchange", () => {
    if (!document.fullscreenElement) {
      triggerHardViolation("fullscreen_exit");
    }
  });
  ```
- **Tab Switching or Window Minimization**:
  Monitored via the Page Visibility API:
  ```typescript
  document.addEventListener("visibilitychange", () => {
    if (document.hidden) {
      triggerHardViolation("tab_switch_or_minimize");
    }
  });
  ```
- **Screenshot Attempts**:
  Keyboard event listeners intercept OS print-screen keybinds:
  ```typescript
  window.addEventListener("keydown", (e) => {
    if (e.key === "PrintScreen") {
      triggerHardViolation("screenshot_attempt");
    }
  });

### 2. Soft Proctoring Violations (Warning Strike System)
Accidental click-outs or window blurs (triggered by OS updates, calendar reminders, or low-battery alerts) utilize a grace period to prevent false positives:
- **Focus Loss Detection**:
  Listening to `window.onblur` and `window.onfocus` tracks window focus:
  ```typescript
  window.addEventListener("blur", () => {
    triggerSoftViolationWarning();
  });
  ```
- **Warning Modal & 10-Second Countdown**:
  On focus loss, a full-screen warning overlay blocks the screen, pausing the countdown timer and voice input. It alerts the candidate and starts a 10-second countdown.
  - If the candidate clicks **"Return to Interview"** and regains window focus within 10 seconds, the overlay clears, and fullscreen mode is re-requested.
  - If focus is not restored in 10 seconds, or if the user accumulates **more than 3 strikes** during a single interview, it upgrades to a Hard Violation and aborts the session.

### 3. Clipboard and Context Menu Lock
To block copying question text or pasting pre-written solutions, the following browser defaults are prevented:
- **Clipboard Block**:
  ```typescript
  // Block copy, cut, and paste on the input and page document
  document.addEventListener("copy", (e) => e.preventDefault());
  document.addEventListener("cut", (e) => e.preventDefault());
  document.addEventListener("paste", (e) => e.preventDefault());
  ```
- **Context Menu Block**:
  ```typescript
  // Disable right-clicks
  document.addEventListener("contextmenu", (e) => e.preventDefault());
  ```

### 4. Developer Tools & Source-Code Interception
Keyboard listeners intercept common shortcut combinations to open inspector panel or view page source:
```typescript
window.addEventListener("keydown", (e) => {
  const isInspector = 
    e.key === "F12" ||
    (e.ctrlKey && e.shiftKey && (e.key === "I" || e.key === "i" || e.key === "J" || e.key === "j")) ||
    (e.metaKey && e.altKey && (e.key === "I" || e.key === "i" || e.key === "J" || e.key === "j"));
  
  const isViewSource = 
    (e.ctrlKey && (e.key === "U" || e.key === "u")) ||
    (e.metaKey && e.altKey && (e.key === "U" || e.key === "u"));

  if (isInspector || isViewSource) {
    e.preventDefault();
    triggerHardViolation("devtools_open_attempt");
  }
});
```

### 5. Backend-Enforced Submission Security
Client-side blocks are reinforced by server-side verification:
- **Order-of-Operations validation**: The server verifies that answers are submitted in order. An answer payload for Question $N$ is only accepted if the database tracks the current session's `questions_attempted` as $N - 1$. Out-of-order requests return a `400 Bad Request`.
- **Duration / Timeout Check**: When an answer is submitted, the server compares the timestamp with the interview's `started_at` plus the total allowed duration (with a 60-second grace period). Submissions beyond this limit are blocked, and the session is compiled as-is.

### 6. Abandonment API Endpoint Flow
All violation paths call the same endpoint to log details without storing screen media:
```typescript
async function triggerHardViolation(reason: string) {
  await fetch(`/api/interview/${interviewId}/abandon`, {
    method: "POST",
    headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
    body: JSON.stringify({ reason }),
  });
  window.location.href = `/dashboard?proctoring=violation&reason=${reason}`;
}
```

## Invariants

Rules the AI agent must never violate:

- API routes contain no UI logic. Components contain no DB or Kimi logic.
- Agent code in `/agent` never imports from `/components` or `/actions`.
- Server Actions never call Kimi directly — Kimi calls only happen in `/agent`, invoked from API routes.
- All database operations use the PostgreSQL connection pool from `lib/db.ts`.
- No hardcoded hex values or raw Tailwind color classes in components — use CSS variables from `ui-tokens.md`.
- Question generation always uses temperature `0.7`; answer evaluation and feedback aggregation always use temperature `0.2`.
- Every interview session must produce a row in `interviews`, `interview_questions` (one per question), and `interview_analytics` on completion — never partial writes left dangling.
- Proctoring violations never store video or screenshots — only a violation reason and timestamp are recorded via the abandon endpoint.
- Voice input never leaves the browser — no audio is uploaded or sent to any API.
- Always scope database queries to the current `user_id` — never query without a user filter.
- `interviews.status` is always one of `in_progress`, `completed`, `abandoned`, `incomplete` — never any other value.
- Resume extraction (`/api/resume/extract`) never auto-saves to the profile — extracted fields are returned for user review/edit before `actions/profile.ts` persists them.
